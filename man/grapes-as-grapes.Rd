\title{\%as\% is a binary operator on strings with units in them}
\usage{
txtUnit \%as\% target
}
\arguments{
\item{txtUnit}{a string with numeric values, including units,
e.g. "3 cm", can be a character vector}

\item{target}{string, target unit, e.g. "m", must be scalar}
}
\value{
a numeric value y: val\emph{originalUnit = y}targetUnit, the
target unit is attached to the returned value, as a comment.
}
\description{
The function calls the units utility and converts the string on the
left into the unit on the right, e.g.: "cm" \%as\% "inches", both
units can contain numbers. Any input that is accepted by the units
utility is acceptable, as long as it makes sense with the command
line arguments: \verb{units --strict --compact -1 "$originalUnit" "$targetUnit"}
}
\examples{
y <- "21 cm" \%as\% "inches"
y <- "12 Î¼mol/L" \%as\% "mol/L"
print(comment(y))
y <- "12 mol/m^3" \%as\% "mmol/L"
}
