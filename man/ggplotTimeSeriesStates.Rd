\usage{
ggplotTimeSeriesStates(
  simulations,
  experiments,
  var.names = NULL,
  type = "boxes",
  plot.states = TRUE,
  ttf = identity,
  xl = "t",
  yl.func = NULL,
  yl.state = NULL,
  MLE = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{simulations}{list of simualtions as output from the simulator}

\item{experiments}{list of experiments}

\item{var.names}{override the rownames of the simulation results}

\item{type}{'boxes' or 'lines'}

\item{plot.states}{TRUE (or FALSE) - whether to plot the state
variables or only the functions}

\item{ttf}{time transformation function - the plot will be against
ttf(t), where \code{t} is a vector of the experiment's output times,
ttf can adjust the time vector if it is very uneven or requires
other modification only when plotting, e.g. \code{seq_along}.}

\item{xl}{x-axis label (time usually)}

\item{yl.func}{y-axis-limits of function plots, can be a list of
ggplot2::ylim() objects, with NULL elements for automatic mode
(the neutral element), NA elements will trigger tight bounds
based on the maximum likelihood estimate and data. a simple
numeric vector will be interpreted as quantiles for the
quantiles function, the first and last quantile of the
simulations will be used as ylim()}

\item{yl.state}{y-axis-limits for state variable plots, with
similar rules as for yl.func}
}
\value{
list of plots with simulations and experimental data
}
\description{
This function plots simulations of time series experiments and plots them
against experimental data. The input in the provided experiments must differ
only in one vector component.
