\title{NATURAL LOG parameter mapping, jacobian}
\usage{
logParMapJac(parMCMC)
}
\arguments{
\item{parMCMC}{the sampling variables (numeric vector)}
}
\description{
This map is used by the simulator to transform sampling variables
into ODE-model porameters. As we often calculate sensitivites, we
alos need the jacobian of the map, due to the chain rule of
differentiation.
