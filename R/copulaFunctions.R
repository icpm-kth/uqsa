#' (for testing) A non-Copula sampling function as fallback
#'
#' If the sample is not suited to infer a Copula (fitCopula fails),
#' this fuction uses much simpler rules to re-draw a new sample from
#' an older sample with some added noise.
#'
#' This can be used during testing, in cases where the acceptance was
#' very low and we have to deal with a very low quality sample This
#' function should work like `base::sample`, but adds small
#' noise. Missing values are always removed.

#' @export
#' @param X an NÃ—M matrix (N is the sample size), M is the number of variables (MCMC or ABC vars)
#' @param sdf factor to increase or decrease the standard deviation of the added noise
#' @param size size of returned sample (passed to `sample.int()`)
#' @param ... passed to `base::sample.int()`
#' @return a matrix with `size` rows and `nrow(X)` columns.
