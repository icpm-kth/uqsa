title: "Importing Models"

```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache = TRUE,
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

The most straightforward way to describe the model is through [SBtab
tables](./SBtab.html), if the model can be described in terms of
reactions, inputs, and outputs. For other models, the user must write
their own likelihood function (or cost-function, or
objective-function).

It is possible to make models compatible with deSolve (but without scheduled events):

```R
model.tsv <- dir(pattern="[.]tsv$",full.names=TRUE)  # file names
sb <- SBtabVFGEN::sbtab_from_tsv(model.tsv)          # a list of data.frames
cl <- SBtabVFGEN::sbtab_to_vfgen(sb,cla=FALSE)       # conservation laws, if any
```

The function `sbtab_to_vfgen` will produce several files, using the
model's name (`Document='model_name'` attribute of SBtab):

- `model_name.vf`, a vfgen compatible file
- `model_name.mod`, a NEURON mod file
- `model_name.xml`, an SBML file, if you have the R bindings to libsbml installed in R and libsbml in your system
- `*.txt`, the math for the ODE system, not tied to any specification (human readable math text files)
- `model.tar.gz`, the same text files, bundled as a zip
- `model.zip`, the same as `tar.gz` but for people who only know `zip`, for compatibility

The vf file is compatible with the [vfgen](https://warrenweckesser.github.io/vfgen/) tool, which creates
code in many languages from this `vf` file (matlab, cvode, octave, python, xppaut).

Alternatively, you can use our tool, which reads the same file, or one of the archive files (`zip`/`tar.gz`).
The repository [icpm-kth/RPN-derivative](icpm-kth/RPN-derivative) contains a
shell script [ode.sh](icpm-kth/RPN/derivative/sh/ode.sh); this script
uses one of three methods to calculate analytical derivatives:
1. [maxima](https://maxima.sourceforge.io/),
2. [yacas](https://yacas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/),
3. the `bin/derivative` binary that RPN-derivative contains (after `make && make install`)

The vfgen tool uses the [ginac](https://www.ginac.de/) library to calculate jacobians.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/icpm-kth/RPN-derivative.git
$ cd RPN-derivative
$ sh/ode.sh -R --maxima ${MODEL:-myModel}.vf
```

Note: `ode.sh` is compatible with the same vf files from SBtabVFGEN,
but doesn't support all of the outputs VFGEN can do, and does nothing
related to delays.

Maxima needs to be installed for this backend to work. Same with
Yacas, if you prefer.

Alternatively:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/icpm-kth/RPN-derivative.git
$ cd RPN-derivative
$ make && sudo make install
$ sh/ode.sh -R MODEL.vf
```

which by default will use the `derivative` binary the third line has
installed, hopefully. The R script created this way contains the
functions that `deSolve` would need to simulate the model, but also
functions that return default initial values, default parameters, the
parameter jacobian, and the output functions (a model of the
measurements available for the system). In the same file, there is a
`model` variable (named *model*) which contains the same functions but
with generic names, e.g.: `model$jac()` is the jacobian
function (_generic_ means that the model name is not part of the
function's name).

# Parameters

Our goal is to perform *parameter estimation*. A *systems biology*
model typically has parameters that are either reaction rate
coefficients $k_f$, equilibrium constants $K_d$, Hill coefficients,
and many other quantities related to *kinetc laws*; they are often
unknown or not uniquely determined yet. But, not all parameters of a
model are unknown, and not all model parameters are intrinsic to the
system we study. Some of them model the interventions we do to the
model when performing an experiment. This could be the frequency of a
driving force for a mechanical model, or the amount of a treatment
dose (added to the system) that affects the time course of reactions:

- a substrate, or buffer
- an enzyme,
- a silencing agent,
- an inhibitor

These parameters are known to us, because they are written down in the
protocol. If the input is time dependent, then its dynamics (or
explicit algebraic functions) have to become part of the model. These
input parameters can be different between experiments, but the
intrinsic parameters are always the same.

The ordinary differential equation on the other hand does not need to
know the distinction between known or unknown parameters. For these
reasons:

```R
parMCMC <- [...]             # some sampling variable
k <- parMap(parMCMC)         # a model compatible parameter vector
u <- experiments[[i]]$input  # a valid model input vector
p <- c(k,u)
# solve ODE using p
```

where `k` are intrinsic, unknown parameters (subject to sampling), and
`u` are the known input parameters that are encoded in the `input`
field of an experiment.

If input parameters `u` exist, then they are always concatenated (`p <-c(k,u)`) 
in that order and passed to the model, the model's C code
only sees `p`. The wrapper functions in the `rgsl` package do this
concatenation when the solver is called. We sample in
logarithmic space, but the solver gets `k` and appends
the right `u` for each experiment, both in linear space.

So, if `parMCMC` is in log10-space, then `parMap` is the
transformation to linear-space for the solver to work in:

```
parMap <- function(par) {
    return(10^(par))
}
```
