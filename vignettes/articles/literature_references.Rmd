# Data references

The experimental data for the AKAP79 and AKAR4 models are from the publication:
```
Church, Timothy W., et al. "AKAP79 enables calcineurin to directly suppress protein kinase A activity." 
Elife 10 (2021): e68164.
```
and described in detail in the SBtab files of the AKAP79 and AKAR4 model folders.

The experimental data for the CaMKII model are extracted from the following references:
```
Stemmer PM, Klee CB. Biochemistry. 1994;33(22):6859-6866 (phenotype 1, 3 and 4)
```
```
O'Donnell SE et al. Proteins. 2011;79(3):765-786 (phenotype 2)
```
and described in detail in the SBtab files of the CaMKII model folder.
