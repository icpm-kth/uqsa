```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache = TRUE,
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

Here are some more examples:

- [Simulate AKAP79 deterministically and add noise](./simAKAP79.html)
- [Simulate AKAP79 stochastically](./simAKAP79stochastic.html)
- [Sample deterministic AKAP79 with ABC](./AKAP79.html)

It is also possible to use ABC for deterministic models, if they are
stochastically embedded in a noise process. So, if we turn on the
`noise` option of the simulator, we can just use ABC on AKAR4, with
similar results as with the deterministic example: [AKAR4 with
ABC](./AKAR4.html)
