```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache = TRUE,
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

Here are some more examples:

- [Sample AKAR4 with Parallel Tempering](./sampleAKAR4mpi.html)
- [Simulate AKAP79 deterministically and add noise](./simAKAP79.html)
- [Simulate AKAP79 stochastically](./simAKAP79stochastic.html)

It is also possible to use a likelihood-free method (specifically, ABC) for deterministic models, if measurement noise is taken into account. So, if we turn on the
`noise` option of the simulator, we can just use ABC on the deterministic (ODE) reaction network models, obtaining
similar results as with the deterministic examples (where likelihood-based MCMC methods were used):
