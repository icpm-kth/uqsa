# Example Models

A simple example using the AKAR4 model is available as a Jupyter notebook in the file [`UQ_AKAR4.ipynb`](https://github.com/icpm-kth/uqsa/blob/master/UQ_AKAR4.ipynb). You can run it locally after installing Jupyter (read [here](https://jupyter.org/install) for further imformation).

Three larger examples are available in the form of R scripts and can be run locally or (preferably) on a computer cluster:

* [AKAP79 ODE model](https://icpm-kth.github.io/uqsa/articles/uqsa-AKAP79.html)

* [CaMKII ODE model](https://github.com/icpm-kth/uqsa/blob/master/inst/extdata/CaMKII/runABCMCMC_CaMKII.R)

* [AKAR4 stochastic model](https://github.com/icpm-kth/uqsa/blob/master/inst/extdata/AKAR4/runABCMCMC_AKAR4_withStochasticStimulation.R)


For the ODE models we added measurement noise or used a acceptance probability in order to allow the use of ABC ([Alahmadi et al 2020](http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsos.191315)).
  
The demo R scrips can be found in the folder [`inst/extdata`](https://github.com/icpm-kth/uqsa/tree/master/inst/extdata).
