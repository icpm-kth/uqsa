UQSA is an R-package for modelling and calibration of biochemical reaction networks.

1. In order to use this package you (obviously) need the 
   [R language](https://www.r-project.org/) (and maybe a graphical interface to it
   [R-studio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)).
2. Once R is available, you can install the UQSA package following the
   [installation instructions](installation.html). The articles on
   this webpage (_Documentation_ at the top) offer explanations to all
   the different features of the package, with examples.
3. After installation, to test that everything is working and to get
   to know UQSA run the introductory example:
   [AKAR4](AKAR4.html)
4. It could be useful to read about the model and data format that we
   use in our examples: use our short [intro to SBtab](SBtab.html) and
   perhaps the official docs [SBtab](https://sbtab.net).
5. Look into more [examples](examples_overview.html).

For very large examples you need to be able to run the sampling
problem (ABC, MCMC) on a cluster (High Performance Computing).

Some of the tools we use to build models are not R packages. This is
why this documentation goes beyond R in some cases.
