UQSA is an R-package for modelling and calibration of biochemical reaction networks.

1. In order to use this package you need to install the [R
language](https://www.r-project.org/) (or
[R-studio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)).
2. Once R is available, you can install the UQSA package foolowing the
   [installation instructions](install.html).
3. After installation, to test that everything is working and to get
   to know UQSA run the introductory example:
   [AKAR4](AKAR4.html)
4. It could be useful to read about the model and data format that we
   use in our examples, [SBtab](https://sbtab.net), and our short [intro to
   SBtab](SBtab.html).
5. Look into more [examples](examples_overview.html).

For very large examples you need to be able to run the sampling
problem (ABC, MCMC) on a cluster (High Performance Computing).
