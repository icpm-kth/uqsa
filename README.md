# Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) and Sensitivity Analysis (SA)

This is an R package that performs *parameter estimation*,
*uncertainty quantification*, and *global sensitivity analysis* using
Bayesian methods and ABC-MCMC sampling. It is primarily designed for **biochemical reaction networks** describing intracellular cellular pathways and similar. All information about the model as well as the experimental data used for parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification is stored in SBtab [1].
