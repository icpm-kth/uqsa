Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) and Sensitivity Analysis (SA)

The code distributed in this repository implements the methodology presented in the paper "Uncertainty quantification, propagation and
characterization by Bayesian analysis combined with global sensitivity analysis applied to dynamical intracellular pathway models" by Eriksson & Jauhiainen et al (2018). The code is distributed under the GNU General Public License v3.0.

The UQ folder contains R scripts to run the uncertainty quantification method (ABC-MCMC with copulas). The packages ks, VineCopula, MASS, R.utils, and R.matlab are required (the last package to save the output data also into a MATLAB compatible file). The main script to run is called runABCMCMC-Phenotype123.R. This script will fit the model to phenotypes 1-3 (as described in the paper), which we use as an illustrative test case. The resulting data is also uploaded in the folder, both in R and MATLAB format. We use phenotype 4 as our prediction dataset to illustrate the SA methodology. 

Th SA folder contains MATLAB scripts to run global sensitivity analysis. A version of MATLAB later than 2014a is required. The main script to run is called get_predictions_do_SA.m and requires access to the file Draws-Phenotype123-Scale1000.mat which is available in the UQ folder. 

### Import an SBtab file in R

To import an SBtab (collection of) file(s) it is possible to use the function `import_from_SBtab` defined in the file "import_from_SBtab.R".

For information about the SBtab data format please refer to [the official git repository](https://github.com/tlubitz/SBtab).

**Input** to function `import_from_SBtab`:
* the directory `SBtabDir` in which the SBtab spreadsheet are saved as tsv files

**Output** of function `import_from_SBtab`:
* an R variable with information from the SBtab spreadsheets

By running function `import_from_SBtab`, two files are created in the same folder given as input to the function (`SBtabDir`):
* `model_name.vf` - SBtab converted into vfgen 
* `model_name.R` - file containing the **vector field** and the **jacobian** of the ODE model described by the SBtab file


Example
`sbtab_var <- import_from_SBtab(SBtabDir)`

### Simulate an ODE-model with function runModel.R

```
runModel <- function(y0, modelFunctionName, params_inputs, outputTimes, outputFunction, environment="R", mc.cores = 8)

```

Function `runModel` simulates the ODE model with name `modelFunctionName` given:
*	a vector `y0`of initial conditions, whose dimension is equal to the dimension of the state variables
*	a matrix `params_inputs`, whose N column vectors are sets of parameters and inputs (first and second part of the vector correspond, respectively, to parameters and inputs)
*	a vector `outputTimes` of T times at which we want to simulate the ODE system
*	a function `outputFunction` that converts a state vector (the solution of the ODE system at given times, in this case) into an output vector
*	a string `environment`, that can be set as `R` or `C` to solve the ODE system, respectively, with the R-solver lsode (from the R package `deSolve`) or the C-solver  gsl_odeiv2 (from the C library `gsl`). The default value is set at environment=`R`.
*	a positive integer `mc.cores` indicating the number of cores to use in the R parallelization. The default value is set at mc.cores = 8.
The output of runModel is a list of N matrices (each element of the list corresponding to a different column vector in the matrix `params_inputs`, i.e. a different parameter/input set). Each matrix of this list has dimension (N_o,T), where N_o is the length of the output vector of function `outputFunction`, and T is the length of the `outputTimes` vector. Element (i,j) of such matrices corresponds to the i-th component of the outputFunction applied to the solution of the ODE system at the j-th time in vector `outputTimes`.
